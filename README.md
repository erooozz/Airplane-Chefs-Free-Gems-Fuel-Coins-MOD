Airplane Chefs is a fast-paced time management game where efficient use of Gems, Fuel, and Coins is key to progressing smoothly and maximizing your airline’s success. Here’s how to use each resource wisely, along with the latest tips and tricks to help you get ahead.

Gems: The Premium Currency
Gems are the rarest and most valuable currency in Airplane Chefs. They offer several powerful advantages:

Speeding Up Progress: Use Gems to instantly finish meal preparations, refill Fuel, or skip waiting times. This is especially useful during events or when you’re close to unlocking a major upgrade.

Unlocking Exclusive Items: Some premium kitchen equipment, decorations, or airline upgrades are only available via Gems. Prioritize spending Gems on permanent upgrades rather than temporary boosts, as these provide long-term benefits.

Purchasing Boosters: Temporary boosts like increased cooking speed or bonus Coins can be bought with Gems. Use these sparingly-save Gems for situations where a boost will help you secure a top leaderboard spot or complete a challenging event.

Claiming Extra Rewards: Occasionally, events or mini-games allow you to spend Gems for additional prizes. Only do this if the reward is significant and will help your overall progress.

Tip: Since Gems are rare, avoid spending them on things you can earn through regular gameplay. Focus on upgrades that permanently improve your kitchen or airline.

Fuel: The Gameplay Limiter
Fuel determines how many flights you can run. Managing Fuel well keeps your progress steady:

Launching Flights: Every flight consumes Fuel. Don’t let your Fuel sit at full capacity-use it regularly to keep earning Coins, experience, and sometimes Gems.

Event Participation: Many limited-time events require Fuel to play. Prioritize event flights when they’re available, as they often offer better rewards.

Continuous Play: If you’re running low on Fuel, you can use Gems to refill it instantly, but only do this during special events or when you’re close to a major milestone.

Tip: Log in frequently to use your Fuel efficiently. Take advantage of daily rewards and login bonuses, which sometimes include Fuel refills.

Coins: The Main Currency
Coins are used for most in-game purchases and upgrades. Here’s how to make the most of them:

Upgrading Kitchens: Invest Coins in better stoves, faster ovens, and increased ingredient storage. Prioritize upgrades that address your current bottlenecks-if you’re struggling to serve food quickly, upgrade appliances first.

Unlocking Airlines and Destinations: Progressing to new locations often requires Coins. Save up for these unlocks, as new airlines bring fresh challenges and rewards.

Buying Ingredients and Customizations: Some recipes need Coins to restock ingredients, and you can also use Coins to decorate your airplanes. Only buy decorative items if you have a surplus of Coins.

Tip: Double your Coin output per level by watching ads, especially on levels where you consistently earn three stars. This can significantly speed up your progress.

Latest Tips and Tricks
Master the Controls: Take time to learn the movement and serving controls. Efficient navigation saves precious seconds, especially in later levels.

Prepare Food in Advance: Always keep your ovens and prep stations busy. As soon as you serve a batch, start cooking the next one. This minimizes downtime and helps you keep up with passenger demands.

Serve Orders Carefully: Don’t rush and risk assembling the wrong dish-mistakes waste both time and resources. Accuracy is just as important as speed.

Restock Frequently: After serving 4–6 orders, return to the kitchen to restock, even if you still have items left. This ensures you’re always ready for complex orders and prevents overcooking food.

Upgrade Strategically: Choose upgrades based on your play style and current challenges. If passengers are getting impatient, upgrade comfort items like pillows and magazines to boost their patience and earn more smiles, which can help you get more Gems.

Watch Ads for Bonuses: Take advantage of ad offers to get free Fuel, Coins, or Gems. This is the easiest way to boost your resources without spending real money.

Participate in Events: Events and challenges often provide the best rewards for your time. Focus your Fuel and resources here whenever possible.

Resource Earning Summary
Gems: Earn through high scores, daily rewards, events, and sometimes by watching ads.

Fuel: Replenished over time, via daily rewards, or by watching ads.

Coins: Mainly earned by completing flights and levels, with bonuses from ads and events.

By prioritizing permanent upgrades, using Fuel efficiently, and maximizing Coin earnings through smart upgrades and ad bonuses, you’ll progress quickly in Airplane Chefs without running into resource shortages. Focus on accuracy, keep your kitchen busy, and participate in events to get the most out of every session.
